# Assemble!: A Event and Attendee Organizer App
Organize events and anyone who wants to attend - without the hassle of signing up!

## Main Features:
* Make events that you want to organize, or find an event to sign up for.
* When making a new event, set an `event code` that you can share with guests you want to invite.
* At the same time, a `secret code` is generated, which anyone can use to edit or delete the event.

## Future Additions:
* On creation, an email is sent to the original creator with the `secret code`
* Shareable links to specific events, either the URL or through emails
* More Mobile-Friendliness
